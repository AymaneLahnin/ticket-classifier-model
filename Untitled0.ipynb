about my account being overdrawn in addition to fraudulent transactions chase charged three separate overdraft fees to my account \\n\\nupon receiving an alert and realizing the problem on  i contacted chase by phone then visited the branch where i opened a claim with chase chase froze the account and informed that it would take  days to process my claim\\n\\ntwo weeks later as of  chase has not refunded my money  around   and is claiming that the investigation is still ongoing \\n\\ni asked why chase can not proceed with reimbursing me while their investigation is ongoing but did not

doesnt know ive figured him out and reported him to the fbi  that the funds never arrived i currently have  xxxx in my business bank account because i was lucky enough to move the small amount of

it in xxxx there is no way i could pay for that \\n\\nwhen i try calling my local branch they ignore my phone calls i tried using their  secure message center  but they send me the same bogus message telling me theyve received my message and that they will give me a call they call me at random times throughout the day and never leave a call back number for almost a month ive been trying to get in

told by the bank and i have a saved receipt that the funds from the check would not be available until xxxxxxxx however somehow someway they were able to initiate the transfer on xxxxxxxx \\n\\non the morning of xxxxxxxx i found out that the client who i believed was legitimate was in fact fraudulent and had been running check fraud schemes since xxxx at this point i called the bank to alert them and to cancel the wire transfer until that point all of that money in my account was usable  im assuming they might have cleared it but i dont really know  \\n\\nthe bank rightfully removed the  from the bounced check however the issue now lies in the  international transfer that was initiated on xxxxxxxx they said they were doing an investigation and simply couldnt reach the other bank so i should reach out to them i know from keeping in contact with the fraudulent client  who doesnt know ive figured him out and reported him to the fbi  that the funds never arrived i currently have  xxxx in my business bank account because i was lucky enough to move the small amount of money i had in the account out of the account but obviously the negative balance impacts my business s credit and i also believe interest on it continues to accrue \\n\\nif i were to pay chase the amount they are claiming i owe they would be unjustly enriched by  not only do i believe that is a wrong and unfair business practice but it also hurts me and my xxxx my xxxx  is brand new i started it in xxxx there is no way i could pay for that \\n\\nwhen i try calling my local branch they ignore my phone calls i tried using their  secure message center  but they send me the same bogus message telling me theyve received my message and that they will give me a call they call me at random times throughout the day and never leave a call back number for almost a month ive been trying to get in contact with a live person about this issue and all i get is automated messages telling me to message them or go to my branch when i go to my branch they tell me theres no way they can get in contact with the transfer people its insane to me as a person whos never seen  anywhere but the movies this is terrifying
